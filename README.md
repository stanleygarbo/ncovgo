# NCovGo - A Covid Tracking System

This repo was cloned from my original private repo and republished in order to remove all credentials that I accidentally pushed 2 years ago.

DATE: May 2021 - June 2021

A tracker that scrapes data from the DOH data drop. The tracking system allows users to check areas that are high in Covid cases and check the vacancy of any hospital, offering convenience and ease of use.
